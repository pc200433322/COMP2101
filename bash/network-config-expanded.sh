#   LAN Name      : net2-linux
#   External IP   : 1.2.3.4

# the LAN info in this script uses a hardcoded interface name of "eno1"
#    - change eno1 to whatever interface you have and want to gather info about in order to test the script

# TASK 1: Dynamically identify the list of interface names for the computer running the script, and use a for loop to generate the report for every interface except loopback

# Data Gathering
################
# the first part is run once to get information about the host
# grep is used to filter ip command output so we don't have extra junk in our output
# stream editing with sed and awk are used to extract only the data we want displayed

#####
# Once per host report
#####
# we use the hostname command to get our system name
my_hostname=$(hostname)

# the default route can be found in the route table normally
# the router name is obtained with getent
default_router_address=$(ip r s default| cut -d ' ' -f 3)
default_router_name=$(getent hosts $default_router_address|awk '{print $2}')

# finding external information relies on curl being installed and relies on live internet connection
external_address=$(curl -s icanhazip.com)
external_name=$(getent hosts $external_address | awk '{print $2}')
